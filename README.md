# Generic-Template-From-React-Bullet-Proof

Configured with Vite + ReactJS + Tailwindcss + HeadlessUI
Minimally adopted folder architecture from react-bullet-proof https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react

This is to potentially save me some time setting up if I have to start a new react project
